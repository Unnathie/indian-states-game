## 📂 Project Files  
- **`main.py`** – The brains of the operation (game logic + interface).  
- **`Indian_states.csv`** – The map of names and their coordinates.  
- **`IndianMap.gif`** – Indian map GIF because Turtle accepts only those.

## 🛠️ Requirements

## ✨ Features  
- Case-insensitive matching — because “punjab” and “Punjab” deserve equal respect.  
- No double-dipping — correct answers only count once.  
- Live scoreboard right in the window title.  
- Confetti moment (well… a winning screen) when you ace all states/UTs.  

---

## 📌 Notes  
- Spelling still matters — “Maharastra” is not “Maharashtra.”  
- Coordinates in `Indian_states.csv` are perfectly tuned for the included map.  
- Swap in a new map + coords for endless geography quiz possibilities.
